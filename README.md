# DjangoREST_Api

This is my student project, the task of which is to learn how to set interaction between client app (in my case, it is designed by Rshiny), django server and database

## Install dependencies

It's require to install third-party dependencies.
For this write in the python console.

```
pip install -r requirements
```

## Running Django server at localhost

After installing necessary dependencies you must run the manage.py file from the server directory with argument `runserver`:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Running Rshiny app locally

To run Rshyny app it's necessary open R console and write:

```
R -e "shiny::runApp('app/app.R')"
```

## Using example
Source files of client app you can find [here](https://github.com/Dannikk/R_client/tree/develop)
